Database of Desi Hip Hop projects

# Aim 
The aim is to maintain maximum information regarding any Desi Hip Hop project.
This large dataset that we are trying to build may be helpful for analysis, marketing or sheer curiosity.

# Current Objective
Our current goal is to use the **Spotify API** to create a dynamically updating list of albums (which is Spotify's terminology includes singles,albums and compilations) given the list of artists

# Next Step
Further information like songwriters, music video directors, marketing team, cover artist and other data that is not directly available in the Spotify API will be added after this list of tracks have been collected.

# Example
Finally the complete dataset will be released with a program that will be able to process queries on that data intuitively.
Example : List of all the projects released in 2019 that are tagged 'Trap'
